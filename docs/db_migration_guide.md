## Overview

The `LND Database Upgrade` process enables node operators to migrate from the legacy **bbolt** key-value store to modern **SQLite** or **PostgreSQL** backends—first in **kvdb mode**, then ultimately to a **relational database** format. This two-stage migration addresses long-standing performance bottlenecks, and lays the foundation for scalable, maintainable node operations.

This guide explains the migration path, backend trade-offs, subsystem readiness, and best practices for safely upgrading your LND database.

## Operation Modes

The LND database upgrade operates in two sequential stages, each with distinct tooling and implications:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    %% 1. Define all nodes
    Bbolt["Bbolt (kvdb)"]
    SQLite["SQLite (kvdb)"]
    Postgres["Postgres (kvdb)"]
    
    M1_Sqlite["Migration #1 (lnd v0.19)<br>Invoices"]
    M2_Sqlite["Migration #2 (lnd v0.20)<br>Graph"]
    M3_Sqlite["Migration #3 (lnd v0.21)<br>Payments"]

    M1_Postgres["Migration #1 (lnd v0.19)<br>Invoices"]
    M2_Postgres["Migration #2 (lnd v0.20)<br>Graph"]
    M3_Postgres["Migration #3 (lnd v0.21)<br>Payments"]

    %% 2. Define all links (within and between graphs)
    Bbolt --> SQLite
    Bbolt --> Postgres
    
    SQLite --> M1_Sqlite
    M1_Sqlite --> M2_Sqlite
    M2_Sqlite --> M3_Sqlite

    Postgres --> M1_Postgres
    M1_Postgres --> M2_Postgres
    M2_Postgres --> M3_Postgres

    %% 3. Group nodes into subgraphs
    subgraph "Step 1: Migration via lndinit"
        Bbolt
        SQLite
        Postgres
    end

    subgraph "Step 2: Migration within lnd"
        M1_Sqlite
        M2_Sqlite
        M3_Sqlite
        M1_Postgres
        M2_Postgres
        M3_Postgres
    end

    %% 4. Apply Styles
    %% Define classes with explicit dark text color (#333)
    classDef bboltNode fill:#e2e3e5,stroke:#383d41,color:#333
    classDef sqliteNode fill:#d4edda,stroke:#155724,color:#333
    classDef postgresNode fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#004085,color:#333

    %% Apply classes to nodes
    class Bbolt bboltNode
    class SQLite,M1_Sqlite,M2_Sqlite,M3_Sqlite sqliteNode
    class Postgres,M1_Postgres,M2_Postgres,M3_Postgres postgresNode
```

- **Stage 1**: Migrate from bbolt to a SQL-based **kvdb** backend using the [lndinit](https://github.com/lightninglabs/lndinit/blob/main/docs/data-migration.md) tool.
- **Stage 2**: Incrementally migrate subsystem data (invoices, graph, payments, etc.) from **kvdb** to SQL native **relational tables** as support becomes available.

---

## Stage 1: Migration from bbolt to SQLite/Postgres (kvdb)

LND cannot run with mixed backends, so all users must first leave bbolt behind. This stage uses the `lndinit` utility to perform an offline migration.

### Choosing Your Target Backend

| Backend   | Performance (in kvdb mode) | Default in LND? | Long-Term Viability |
|-----------|--------------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Postgres  | Mediocre                 | No               | ✅ |
| SQLite    | Good                     | **Yes (future)** | ✅ |

> 💡 **Recommendation**: Unless you require Postgres for infrastructure reasons,
 **migrate to SQLite kvdb** as your backend.

### Postgres kvdb Migration

A migration script is available via `lndinit`:

- [Postgres migration script](https://github.com/lightninglabs/lndinit/blob/main/docs/data-migration.md#using-postgres-as-the-destination-remote-database)
- **Caveat**: Users report degraded performance in kvdb mode. Only proceed if you plan to **immediately follow with Stage 2** to migrate the available data stores to relational DB.
This will mitigate the poor Postgres performance on kvdb.

### SQLite kvdb Migration

- [SQLite migration script](https://github.com/lightninglabs/lndinit/blob/main/docs/data-migration.md#using-sqlite-as-the-destination-remote-database)
- **Advantage**: Maintains good performance while waiting for full relational migration.

---

## Stage 2: Migration from kvdb to Relational Database

This stage unlocks true SQL performance by restructuring data into relational tables. Migration is **per-subsystem** and **incremental**.

### Subsystem Readiness

| Subsystem           | Relational Backend | Migration Script | Status |
|---------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------|
| Invoices            | ✅ Available        | ✅              | Available with **v0.19** |
| Graph               | ✅ Available        | ✅              | Available with **v0.20** |
| Payments            | 🚧 In Progress      | Planned          | Targeted with **v0.21**|
| Btcwallet           | 🚧 In Progress      | Planned          | Targeted with **v0.21**|
| Forwarding History  | ❌ TBD              | ❌ TBD            | Future work |

## Known Limitations and Edge Cases

- **Single database engine required**: LND requires a single consistent backend.
You cannot run invoices in relational mode while graph remain in kvdb *unless*
both are on the same SQL engine (e.g., SQLite).
- **Data loss risk**: Always **back up your `data/` directory** before migration.
- **Downtime required**: Stage 1 requires LND to be offline. Stage 2 is done at startup, requiring a LND restart.
- **Postgres kvdb performance**: Postgres performance on kvdb is sub-optimal. It is
recommended to make the stage 2 migration immediately to avoid performance bottlenecks. Certain RPCs like `listpayments` may not perform well on Postgres if the node has a lot of payments data. If your node operation is heavy
on payments and `listpayments` performance is critical for you, we'd recommend
not doing any migration and wait till version 0.21.0 is released.
- **No migration path between SQL backend**: Once migrated to either Postgres or
SQLite, it is not possible to switch to the other, so choose your target backend carefully.
---

## Best Practices for Node Operators

### Choosing the Right Path

- **For most users**: Choose SQLite, then migrate. Later, adopt relational backends subsystem-by-subsystem.
- **Enterprise/Postgres users**: It is recommened to wait to start the migration 
until **payments relational backend** is ready, then perform **Stage 1 + Stage 2 in quick succession**.

### Timing Your Migration

- Perform migrations during **low-activity periods**.
- Monitor LND release notes for relational DB support of different subsystems.

### Validation

1. Stop LND.
2. Run migration with `lndinit`.
3. Start LND with new backend flags, to execute stage 2 migrations.
4. Validate node health: channels, balance, invoice/payment history.

---

## Implementation Examples

### Migrating to SQLite kvdb

```bash
# Stop LND
lnd --shutdown

# Backup
cp -r ~/.lnd ~/lnd-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Run migration (e.g. sqlite)
lndinit --debuglevel info migrate-db \
--source.bolt.data-dir ~/.lnd/data \
--dest.backend sqlite \
--dest.sqlite.data-dir ~/.lnd/data --network mainnet

# Start LND with SQLite backend
lnd --db.backend=sqlite
```

> 📝 Add `db.backend=sqlite` to your `lnd.conf` to make it persistent.

### Migrating Invoices to Relational Backend

Once on LND v0.19+ with SQLite/Postgres:

```bash
# Ensure backend is set
echo "db.backend=sqlite" >> ~/.lnd/lnd.conf

# Start LND — invoice migration runs automatically
lnd
```

Check logs for:
```
Migrating invoices from kvdb to relational format...
Invoice migration completed successfully.
```

## Future Improvements

The LND team is actively working on:

- **Payments relational backend** and migration tooling (Stage 2)
- **Btcwallet relational backend** and migration tooling (Stage 2)
- **Forwarding history** relational schema (long-term)
- **Automatic detection** of migration readiness in `lnd`

Node operators should monitor:
- [LND GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases)
- [lndinit repository](https://github.com/lightninglabs/lndinit)

---

## Conclusion

The LND database upgrade is a strategic two-stage process designed to eliminate bbolt performance limitations while ensuring data integrity and operational continuity.

By **first migrating to SQLite/Postgres kvdb** and **then adopting relational backends incrementally**, node operators can achieve significant performance gains—especially for payment-heavy workloads—without rushing into unstable configurations.

Choose your path wisely, back up rigorously, and stay informed. The future of LND is relational, and this guide ensures you get there safely.
